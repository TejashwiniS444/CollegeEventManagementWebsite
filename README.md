## ðŸ“˜ About This Project

The **College Event Management Website** is a web application designed to manage and streamline the registration and coordination of events in a college environment. 

This project allows:
- Students to register for college events through an interactive form.
- Admins to view the list of registered participants.
- Users to view upcoming events via a dynamic events page.

The system was developed collaboratively by multiple contributors using Git and GitHub. Each feature was built in a separate branch and merged into the main project via pull requests, simulating a real-world software development workflow.

Key components of the project:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub collaboration (branches, commits, PRs)

This project serves as a demonstration of teamwork, web development, and version control best practices in an academic setting.
